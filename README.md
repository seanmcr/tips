This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.The following **additional** features are implemented:  [*] Added ‘Custom’ field to allow users to type in an arbitrary tip percentage (TextField only appears if/when the ‘Custom’ value is selected)## Video Walkthrough Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:<img src=“http://i.imgur.com/UEtpKz0.gif">
